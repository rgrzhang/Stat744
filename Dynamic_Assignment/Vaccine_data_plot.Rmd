**BMB**: I wouldn't use `include=FALSE` here. Good to
be explicit about which packages you're using (this won't
show up in the document)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

**BMB**: it's best practice to name all your chunks

```{r}
dat1<-(read_csv("vaccine_data_online.csv")
       %>% select(c(disease,year,cases)))
head(dat1)
```



```{r}
gg1<-(ggplot(dat1,aes(x=year,y=cases,colour=disease))+
        geom_line()
)
ggp1<-ggplotly(gg1)
ggp1
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
